# Abilities
## Able Assistant (Ex)
A valet’s master treats the valet as if it had the Cooperative Crafting feat and shares Craft skills and item creation feats with the valet.

This replaces alertness.

## Empathic Link (Su)
The master has an empathic link with her familiar to a 1 mile distance. The master can communicate emphatically with the familiar, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link’s limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. The master has the same connection to an item or place that her familiar does.

## Teammate (Ex)
A valet is considered to have all the teamwork feats its master has.

This replaces improved evasion.

## Magical Manipulation (Sp)
A valet can cast [[Reference/Magic/Spells/Open-Close|Open-Close]] and [[Reference/Magic/Spells/Prestidigitation|Prestidigitation]] at will.

This replaces share spells.

## Store Spells
Starting at 1st level, a witch’s familiar stores all of the spells that the witch knows. This does not allow the familiar to cast these spells or use spell-trigger or spell completion magic items. Starting at 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch’s familiar adds new bonus spells to the witch’s spell list based on her patron. These spells are automatically stored by the familiar and can be prepared as normal once they are gained.

## Deliver Touch Spells (Su)
If a witch is 3rd level or higher, her familiar can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the witch and the familiar are in contact at the time the witch casts a touch spell, she can designate her familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the witch would. As usual, if the witch casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the witch activates a hex, her familiar can be used to make the touch. She does not have to be in contact with the familiar to use this ability.
At 3rd level, when delivering a harmless touch spell to a willing creature, a valet can move before and after delivering the spell, as long as its total movement does not exceed its speed.

This alters deliver touch spells.

## Speak with Master (Ex)
If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.

## Deliver Aid (Ex)
At 7th level, a valet can move before and after using the aid another action, as long as its total movement does not exceed its speed.

This replaces speak with animals of its kind.
