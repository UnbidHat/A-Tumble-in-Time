**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th; **Slot** ring; **Price** 2,500 gp; **Weight** â€”

```ad-description
This ring continually provides its wearer with life-sustaining nourishment. The ring also refreshes the body and mind; its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. This allows a spellcaster that requires rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but this does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day. The ring must be worn for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to himself.
```

```ad-conreq
**Feats** Forge Ring; **Spells** create food and water; **Cost** 1,250 gp
