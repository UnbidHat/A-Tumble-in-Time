You may spend a spell point to understand all spoken and written words, regardless of language. You may spend an additional spell point to also be understood by any creature with a language. You do not learn the creature’s language, but instead every creature hears you speak in whatever language is most comfortable for it.

While this sense is active, you may understand languages even if you lack the senses to normally interpret them. For example, a blind character can use this sense to “read” written language by touching it or a deaf character can use it to read the lips of any creature they can perceive.
