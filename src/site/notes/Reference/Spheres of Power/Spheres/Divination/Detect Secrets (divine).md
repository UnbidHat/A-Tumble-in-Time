You may spend a spell point to divine for things expressly designed to be hidden. This includes secret doors, hidden caches, and secret compartments. Not only does this detect the presence of such secrets, but it also gives you knowledge of their trigger mechanisms. This only detects doors, passages, and openings specifically designed to avoid detection.
