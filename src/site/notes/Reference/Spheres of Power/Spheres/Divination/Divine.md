You can predict the future and gain information not available to the usual 5 senses.

# Divine
You may divine to gain information. To divine, you must spend 1 minute meditating, although you may spend a spell point to decrease this time to a single standard action. Divining always has a duration of concentration, but you must spend a full-round action concentrating (you can take no other action except free actions); you are flat-footed while concentrating on divining. Divining reveals information from sources within medium range of you as an emanation; it reveals information each round the effect it is maintained. Divining can penetrate most barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it.

When you gain the Divination sphere, you gain the ability to divine for magical auras, learning their strength and location. You do not know the exact caster level of an item or spell, but you may sense the auraâ€™s general strength according to the chart below. To determine the spell school or sphere of the effect, you must succeed at a Knowledge (arcana) check with a DC equal to 15 + 1/2 the caster level.

Table: Aura Strength
Caster Level	Aura Strength
1-5	Faint
6-11	Moderate
12-20	Strong
21+	Overwhelming
A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of spells and sphere effects) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). In such a case, divining reveals an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

Table: Lingering Aura
Original Strength	Duration of Lingering Aura
Faint	1d6 rounds
Moderate	1d6 minutes
Strong	1d6 x 10 minutes
Overwhelming	1d6 days
When using Spellcraft to identify the properties of a magic item or ongoing effect, you may use divine in place of the detect magic spell. Outsiders and elementals are not magical in and of themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration effect registers.

Overwhelming Auras: Whenever an individual divines or senses an aura whose strength is overwhelming, from a source whose Hit Dice or caster level is equal to or greater than the caster's character level + 10, that individual becomes stunned for 1 round.

# Alternate Divinations
If you possess certain other spheres, you may divine for information other than magical auras. These alternate divinations are detailed below.

## Destruction
Divine Hostility: You may divine whenever a creature or an object within range takes hit point damage. In addition, you gain knowledge as to the amount and type of damage dealt and from what direction the damage was dealt from. If the source of the damage is inside the area of your divine effect, you also learn what square the source occupied.

## Time
Divine Time: You may divine the events that happened within range. You can only divine what occurred up to 1 hour per caster level in the past. When you divine time you are only given the following details: The number of creatures that were in the area, their size, how long they remained in the area, and any movements they made while in the area. In addition, if objects were left unattended or unattended objects were moved during this time, you learn the size and vague shape of such objects.

## Warp
Divine Warp: You may divine the presence of portals, rifts (including extradimensional spaces), and teleportation circles, both active and inactive within range. If you perceived a target teleport within the last hour, this also reveals to you the general direction and distance of their teleportation. If the creature teleports to a different plane, you immediately learn this, but you do not learn to what plane the creature teleported unless your caster level is at least 10. Should you find yourself on that plane before the hour is up, you can divine their general direction and distance.
