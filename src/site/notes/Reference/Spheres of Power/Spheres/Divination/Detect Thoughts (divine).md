You may divine the emotions of creatures you can see within range (Will negates), and you gain a circumstance bonus to Sense Motive checks equal to 1/2 your caster level vs. creatures you have thus successfully divined. You do not know the motivation or source behind why a creature is feeling the emotion. If you spend an additional spell point, you divine not only the emotions of those within range, but also the surface thoughts (Will negates).
