You gain a permanent extradimensional space that may hold up to 10 pounds per caster level of non-living material. You can create a portal to this extradimensional space within armâ€™s reach at will. Placing an object in this space or calling an object from this space requires a full-round action, but may be done as a swift action by spending a spell point. Living things and attended objects cannot be placed in your extradimensional storage. If you die (or are destroyed, if you lack a Constitution score), all contents of your extradimensional space appear in your square or the nearest unoccupied space.

You may take this talent two times; when taken a second time your extradimensional space may hold an additional 15 pounds per caster level, for a total of 25 pounds per caster level. In addition, you may place or withdraw an object from your extradimensional space as a move action instead of a full-round action, which counts as drawing the equipment normally. If the object would normally be worn or have to be donned in some way (such as armor or a magic ring), you may remove or don it as part of the same action as placing or withdrawing it from storage.
