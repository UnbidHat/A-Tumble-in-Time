You can spend a standard action to teleport yourself and up to a heavy load to any place within close range. Alternatively, you may teleport a touched willing creature and their carried equipment instead of yourself. You may spend a spell point to increase your teleport range to medium instead of close. You must have line of sight to your destination.
