You can use destructive power.

# Destructive Blast
As a standard action, you may deliver a burst of blunt magical force as a melee touch attack or a ranged touch attack within close range. A destructive blast is subject to spell resistance, and while it bypasses DR/magic, it does not automatically bypass other forms of damage reduction if it deals physical damage (bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing). A ranged destructive blast counts as a ray attack.

A basic destructive blast deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every odd caster level.


Level	Damage
1st	1d6
3rd	2d6
5th	3d6
7th	4d6
9th	5d6
11th	6d6
13th	7d6
15th	8d6
17th	9d6
19th	10d6
21st	11d6
23rd	12d6
25th	13d6

You may spend 1 spell point when making a destructive blast to increase the damage dealt to one damage die per caster level (minimum 2d6).
