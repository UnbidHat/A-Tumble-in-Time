By connecting the target to versions of themselves that exist in alternate timelines, you grant the target an insight bonus on all Knowledge checks equal to 1/2 your caster level and the ability to attempt such checks untrained. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point to allow it to remain for 1 minute per caster level without concentration.

As an immediate action, you may spend a spell point to end this effect on the target and apply the insight bonus to their AC against a single attack or to a single saving throw by giving them a surge of revelation from a version of themselves that has already survived the attack or effect in another timeline.
