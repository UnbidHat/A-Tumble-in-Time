You can alter the flow of time itself.

# Alter Time
The base Time sphere grants you two methods to alter time. All alter time effects require a standard action to activate (unless otherwise stated) and have a range of touch, and are subject to spell resistance. Effects that target an area are centered on you. Effects maintained through concentration require you to remain within close range of the target or location after placing the effect.

When you gain the Time sphere, you gain the following ways to alter time:

## Haste
You grant the target increased speed. The target gains a +10 feet enhancement bonus to all forms of movement, as well as a +1 bonus to attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This increases by +10 feet per 5 caster levels, and a +1 bonus per 10 caster levels. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point as a free action to allow it to remain for 1 round per caster level without concentration.

## Slow
You slow the targetâ€™s movements and perception of time. The target has its movement speeds halved (minimum 5 feet) and suffers a -1 penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves (Will negates). This penalty increases by 1 per 10 caster levels you possess. You must concentrate to maintain this effect, but may spend a spell point as a free action to increase its duration to 1 round per caster level without concentration.

If a Haste and Slow ability are used on the same creature, the second caster must attempt a magic skill check against the effect of the first caster. On a failure the target is unaffected. On a success, the effects counter each other, leaving neither in place.
